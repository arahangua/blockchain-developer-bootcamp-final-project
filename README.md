# Project proposal evaluation / survey contract
(very basic DAO like idea...) 

## Background
### Problem : 
There's a rule of thumb in the world of entrepreneurship : if someone wants to check whether his/her idea is market-viable, simply ask around and get at least 100 people who like the idea (who would pay something). If there are more than 100 people, then we are good to go :)

Already SNS services are great channels to do this quick surveying, however, from a long-term perspective, it is important to get on-going feedback cycle. (from potential customers to the entrepreneur and the other way around) 

### Solution:
Blockchain voting or DAO system in general provides an ideal environment for this. "Proposal appraisal" contract that can both evaluate the proposal and create feedback community would be interesting.

## Project idea (WIP) : 
Implement proposal appraisal contact that:
1) Give project proposer the survey result
2) Match project proposer with participants who liked the idea   

### points to consider 
1. Assume that we already have bustling community (n of participants > 300)
2. Participants get randomly introduced to existing proposals
3. Participant can give one of 3 answers to a proposal : 1) I like it 2) No, not a good idea 3) I don't quite understand the proposal
4. If the proposal gets more than 100 1) "likes" then it is accepted
5. When the proposal is accepted, those who voted for "like" and proposer get "matched" (they get introduced into their own communication channel)
6. Proposer also gets the result e.g. # of likes / 300 participants
