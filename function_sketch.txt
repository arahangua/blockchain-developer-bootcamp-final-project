    //sends out result because of the timeout
}


// need to make modifiers to check eligibility of participants

modifier isValidVoter(){

} 

modifier hasVoted(){
    //trivial....
}

modifier isVotingOngoing(){

}

modifier isTimeout(){

}



// events 

event loghasVoted(address)
event logVotingstarted()
